# CODEX Activity Log

This file summarizes tasks requested of CODEX and a brief description of how CODEX responded.

## Entry 1 - Creating CODEXLOG.md

**Task:** Create a file called CODEXLOG.md that will describe what task was asked to CODEX and a summary of what CODEX did. This file will be updated in every task.

**Summary:** CODEX created CODEXLOG.md and added this initial entry to log future activities.

## Entry 2 - Adding CODEXLOG agent instructions

**Task:** Add a new "CODEXLOG" agent description in AGENTS.md so that CODEX appends to CODEXLOG.md after each task.

**Summary:** Updated AGENTS.md with a dedicated CODEXLOG agent section describing how the log should be maintained. Appended this entry to record the update.

## Entry 3 - Continue working with the PLAN

**Task:** Continue implementing features from PLAN.md, focusing on the GUI skeleton and calibration utilities.

**Summary:** Added basic image loading and segmentation controls to `gui/main_window.py`, implemented calibration utilities under `src/utils`, updated the CLI entry point, and expanded tests accordingly.

## Entry 4 - Fix QAction Import

**Task:** Resolve error due to missing QAction attribute from QtWidgets by importing QAction from QtGui and updating usage.

**Summary:** Updated `gui/main_window.py` to import `QAction` from `PySide6.QtGui` and replaced references to QtWidgets with direct class imports. All tests pass.

## Entry 5 - Display Image at Native Size

**Task:** Adjust the GUI so loaded images are shown at their original dimensions instead of being fit to the view.

**Summary:** Modified `load_image` in `gui/main_window.py` to reset the view transform and set the scene rectangle to the pixmap's bounds. Added a corresponding unit test to verify the image dimensions and transform. All tests pass (GUI tests skipped if PySide6 unavailable).

## Entry 6 - Expand Window to Image Size

**Task:** Ensure that when an image is loaded, the main window grows to match the image dimensions rather than constraining the view.

**Summary:** Updated `load_image` to set the graphics view size to the pixmap's bounding rectangle and call `adjustSize()` so the window expands. Extended the GUI test to confirm the view size matches the image.

## Entry 7 - Overlay Contours and Save Image

**Task:** Continue with the plan by integrating contour overlays after segmentation and adding a feature to save the annotated image.

**Summary:** Implemented `find_contours` in `segmentation.py` and updated `MainWindow` to draw contour overlays using `QPainterPath`. Added a "Save Annotated Image" action and method that render the scene to a file. Extended processing and GUI tests to cover these new capabilities.


## Entry 8 - Calibration Dialog

**Task:** Continue with the plan by adding calibration features to allow setting pixel-to-millimeter scaling from a reference line in the image.

**Summary:** Implemented an interactive `CalibrationDialog` that lets the user draw a line on the image and enter its real-world length. The dialog computes pixels-per-millimeter using `calibrate_from_points` from updated `utils.calibration`. The main window now launches this dialog via the Tools menu. Utility functions for conversions were added along with new tests.

## Entry 9 - Batch Processing

**Task:** Continue with the plan by implementing batch mode to process directories of images and export results.

**Summary:** Added a functional `run_batch` in `src/batch.py` that loads each image, applies Otsu thresholding and morphological cleanup, counts contours, and collects basic stats into a pandas DataFrame. Results can be saved to CSV. Created `tests/test_batch.py` to verify batch processing and CSV output.
