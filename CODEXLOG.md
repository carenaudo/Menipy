# CODEX Activity Log

This file summarizes tasks requested of CODEX and a brief description of how CODEX responded.

## Entry 1 - Creating CODEXLOG.md

**Task:** Create a file called CODEXLOG.md that will describe what task was asked to CODEX and a summary of what CODEX did. This file will be updated in every task.

**Summary:** CODEX created CODEXLOG.md and added this initial entry to log future activities.

## Entry 2 - Adding CODEXLOG agent instructions

**Task:** Add a new "CODEXLOG" agent description in AGENTS.md so that CODEX appends to CODEXLOG.md after each task.

**Summary:** Updated AGENTS.md with a dedicated CODEXLOG agent section describing how the log should be maintained. Appended this entry to record the update.

## Entry 3 - Continue working with the PLAN

**Task:** Continue implementing features from PLAN.md, focusing on the GUI skeleton and calibration utilities.

**Summary:** Added basic image loading and segmentation controls to `gui/main_window.py`, implemented calibration utilities under `src/utils`, updated the CLI entry point, and expanded tests accordingly.

## Entry 4 - Fix QAction Import

**Task:** Resolve error due to missing QAction attribute from QtWidgets by importing QAction from QtGui and updating usage.

**Summary:** Updated `gui/main_window.py` to import `QAction` from `PySide6.QtGui` and replaced references to QtWidgets with direct class imports. All tests pass.
